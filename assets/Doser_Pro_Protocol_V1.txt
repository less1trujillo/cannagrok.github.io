*** FLOWERFORM DOSER PRO: SCIENTIFIC TITRATION PROTOCOL (V1) ***

Thank you for purchasing the Doser PRO Protocol.

I. THE STARTING BASELINE (STANDARD)
* Initial Dose (Micro): 2.5mg - 5mg THC.
* Tolerance Check: Wait 90 minutes. Do not increase until the next session.

II. THE TITRATION FORMULA (ADJUSTMENT)
* ADJUSTMENT FACTOR: [Base Dose] x [Effect Desired Factor] / [Tolerance Level (1-5)]
* Example: If 5mg was too light (Tolerance 3), try 7mg next time.
* NEVER jump more than 2mg between sessions. Slow and steady titration is key to precision.

III. THE TERPENE ENHANCEMENT
* If using a Myrcene-dominant strain (like Granddaddy Purple), reduce the dose by 1mg for sedation optimization.
* If using a Limonene-dominant strain (like Sour Diesel), increase the dose by 1mg for mental clarity optimization.
